## Welcome to Auto Business Manager
- Auto Business Manager relies on both 2Take1 and autoexec.lua to work as intended

## How does Auto Business Manager work?
- This script enables the user to toggle business manager on/off via 2Take1
- This scripts core function is to allow the user to save their settings so it can be utilized with autoexec

## NOTE: VIP status is required to utilize this script as it relies on 2Take1's functions
- This script utilizes functions that require VIP access to 2Take1
- Without VIP access, this script will not work

## 2Take1
- You can purchase access from the following link:

## autoexec.lua
- Proddy's Script Manager v2.2.1

  - In order for this script to function as intended, it is required to autoload it with proddy's script above
